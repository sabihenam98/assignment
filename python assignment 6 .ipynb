    "# Question 1:\n",
    "\tDefine Object Oriented Programming Language?\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "\tObject-Oriented Programming (OOP) is the term used to describe a programming approach based on objects and classes. The object-oriented paradigm allows us to organize software as a collection of objects that consist of both data and behavior. This is in contrast to conventional functional programming practice that only loosely connects data and behavior.\n",
